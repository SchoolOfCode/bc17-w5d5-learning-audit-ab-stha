Example (showing reflection of one module):
Learning Audit for Front End only.

- Semantic HTML and Basic of CSS Layouts (RED)
- DOM selectors (RED)
- Button click and Form Submit (GREEN)
- Fetch (ORANGE)
- Async JavaScript (GREEN)
- Async/Await (ORANGE)

Learning Plan and Priorities

Semantic HTML / CSS Layouts:
Found it hard to put into practice. I wasn’t sure when to use certain tags. I need to build a few more websites with HTML to get used too quickly and correctly structuring a page.
CSS Grid was ok, I could build basic stuff. But I found Flexbox quite difficult and all I wanted to do was align some items. I want to practice making a website header with a logo, navigation list and button.
DOM
I was able to get DOM nodes but found it hard to change text values in nodes. I need write some simple JS that selects DOM nodes and reads text or html attributes.
Fetch
I could write a simple fetch request but I found error handling hard. I still don’t get how it works. I want to write a small script to get data from an API but I’ll turn off my internet to see how to handle errors (like no internet)

- Manipulating DOM elements (AMBER)
- Event listeners (AMBER)
- Asynchronous JavaScript and functions (GREEN)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Week 4 - Back End Engineering:

- node and npm (GREEN)
- RESTful APIs (RED)
- Server to client and API relationship (GREEN)
- requests and HTTP methods (AMBER)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Week 5 - Database Engineering:

- Intro to Databases (GREEN)
- SQL commands and functions (GREEN)
- Joins - self-joins (AMBER)
- .env files and environment variables (RED)
- pg package (node) and pool.query injections (RED)

Learning Audit for Week 5 - Database Engineering:

- Since my group in week 4 didn't get do the PUT, PATCH, or DELETE HTTP methods,
I will work on the hackathon from week 5 because this way I can practice my pool.query injections as well
as work on the HTTP methods.
